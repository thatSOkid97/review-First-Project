				<h2>What is the meaning of travelling?</h2>
				<p>
				Travelling the world is something that be both exciting and terrifying,
				from my experiences first hand of just travelling to a few countries such
				as, Dubai, Nigeria, Portugal and Cyrus, it had elements of excitement
				and slight fear of the unknown of visiting my background country of Nigeria
				and then three foregin countries.

					<h3>French Connections</h3>
					<p>
					France the place of romance or so I'm told. I have not yet been to France,
					but from what I have seen and heard it looks like it would be the most
					fun travelling and experiencing all of its beauty, both on your own or
					with family and friends. So what's on offer in France:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#">The Elfel Tower</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">The resturants</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">The wine</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">The fashion shows</a></li>
					</ul>

					<h3>Italian Stallion</h3>
					<p>
					Italian people are friendly or well the ones I've encountered have been
					very friendly and kind towards me, which has given me such a good
					perception of them. So what's on offer in Italy:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="#">Rome</a></li>
						<li><a href="#">The wine</a></li>
